## Performance Metrics

This study employs multiple evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess model performance across the 5-class accent classification task:

### Primary Metrics

**Accuracy**: Overall classification correctness across all accent classes
```
Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Samples
```

**Precision**: True positive rate for each accent class, measuring the model's ability to avoid false positives
```
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
```

**Recall (Sensitivity)**: The model's ability to detect each accent class, measuring true positive rate
```
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
```

**F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing balanced performance assessment
```
F1-Score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

### Secondary Metrics
- **Training Time**: Wall-clock time for model convergence
- **Inference Time**: Per-sample prediction latency
- **Memory Usage**: Peak GPU memory consumption during training
- **Parameter Count**: Total trainable parameters in the model
